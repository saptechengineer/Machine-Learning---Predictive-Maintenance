# Predictive Maintenance of Packaging Machine | Motor
An application that predicts the probability of a Packaging Machine | Motor Breakdown based on below attributes:
- Voltage/current supply (V ~50 - 60),
- Continuous running time of motor (Minutes ~ <=60),
- Avarage Speed of motor (RPM ~800 - 1000),
- motor vibration (Hertz ~5-8),
- Total weight of goods packed (grams ~<=100000),
- Temparature of motor (Celsius ~50-60)
